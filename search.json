One topic of my research is to incorporate state-of-the-art high performance computing concepts, techniques and practice, deep learning models and advanced InSAR processing algorithms for faster and more robust InSAR processing. The reserach results are summarized and opened in an InSAR post processing package moraine which is under rapid development.\nI am also interesed in applying InSAR for understanding and characterizing geodynamic phenomena (e.g. landslides).\n\n \n  \n   \n  \n    \n     E-mail\n  \n  \n    \n     Github\n  \n  \n    \n     CV"
