## Bio
I am currently a PhD student in [Southern Methodist University][smu] advised by [Prof. Zhong Lu][zhonglu]. Before that, I receive my BS degree in Geophysics at [University of Science and Technology and China][ustc_website] in 2020.

In the SAR big data era, the efficiency of mining valuable information from massive SAR data is limited by 
traditional InSAR processing techniques which require too much manual intervention and checking and computing time.
One topic of my research is to incorporate state-of-the-art high performance computing concepts, techniques 
and practice, deep learning models and advanced InSAR processing algorithms for faster and more robust InSAR processing.
The reserach results are summarized and opened in an InSAR post processing package [moraine][moraine_website]
which is under rapid development.

I am also interesed in applying InSAR for understanding and characterizing geodynamic phenomena (e.g. landslides).
